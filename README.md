# PIC18F25K83 PWM servo and printf demo
---------------------------------------

This is a demo project in answer to a question on Stack Overflow.

See: https://www.microchip.com/forums/FindPost/1152262

This project was created with the MPLABX v5.40 Code Configurator.

The application is to use three PWM function blocks to produce 
pulses that set the position of hobby class servo motors.

The test application is minimal in the extreme as it sets 
SERVO1 at -45, SERVO2 at 0 and SERVO3 at +45 degrees..
